## Abstract

While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require
memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack
sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems'
fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way.
Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected
knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note
containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then
analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist.
Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the
contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously
refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the
flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical
experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for
evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/A-mem, while the source code of the agentic memory
system is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/A-mem-sys.
