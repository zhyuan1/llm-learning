## Abstract

We introduce Zep, a novel memory layer service for AI agents that outperforms the current state-of-the-art system,
MemGPT, in the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR) benchmark. Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging
evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While existing retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) frameworks for large language model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval,
enterprise applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources including ongoing conversations and
business data. Zep addresses this fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti -- a temporally-aware
knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both unstructured conversational data and structured business data
while maintaining historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team established as their primary
evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further
validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better reflects enterprise use cases through complex
temporal reasoning tasks. In this evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up to 18.5%
while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to baseline implementations. These results are
particularly pronounced in enterprise-critical tasks such as cross-session information synthesis and long-term context
maintenance, demonstrating Zep's effectiveness for deployment in real-world applications.
