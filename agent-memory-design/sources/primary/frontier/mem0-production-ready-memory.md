## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent responses, yet
their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged multi-session
dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically
extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations. Building on this foundation,
we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational
structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically
compare our approaches against six baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii)
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes
the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a
dedicated memory management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform all existing
memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves
26% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with graph memory achieves around 2%
higher overall score than the base configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead
compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost,
offering a compelling balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings
highlight critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the
way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.
